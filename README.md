# PhD Proposal: Selection of Variables for Cluster Analysis with Application to DHS Data in Cameroon

This repository contains the LaTeX source code for the PhD proposal titled "Selection of Variables for Cluster Analysis with Application to DHS Data in Cameroon".

## Author

*   **Author:** Ayendoh Terrence Sama
*   **Supervisors:** Dr. M.S. Madukaife and Dr. E.O. Ossai

## Description

This research proposal outlines a study to develop and evaluate a procedure for variable selection in cluster analysis, particularly for high-dimensional datasets like the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data. The proposed methodology aims to improve the accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency of clustering by identifying and selecting the most informative variables.

## File Descriptions

*   `proposal.tex`: The main LaTeX file for the proposal. It contains the entire structure and content of the document.
*   `references.bib`: The BibTeX file containing all the bibliographic references cited in the proposal.
*   `images/logo.png`: The university logo used in the title page of the proposal.
*   `GEMINI.md`: A file containing an analysis of the project structure and files, generated by a large language model.

## How to Compile

To compile the LaTeX project and generate a PDF of the proposal, you will need a working LaTeX distribution (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX). The following commands can be used to compile the document:

```bash
pdflatex proposal.tex
bibtex proposal
pdflatex proposal.tex
pdflatex proposal.tex
```

This sequence of commands ensures that the table of contents, citations, and references are all correctly generated.
